# iPRETIX

## Goals for 1.0

### Login
- User needs to enter the organizer-slug and the event-slug
- obtain API token, save it to keychain, use it with the `Authorization: Token`-Header

### Scan Tickets
- read the barcode from a pretix-ticket
- validate it against the server (or against downloaded ticket-data, this is more a 1.1 feature?)

## TODO

- [ ] find a better name
